            This is my first paragraph in my new webpage. This is going to be great. I am so excited I can hardly contain myself. Don't you just love paragraphs? I find them very useful.

            Yes, that's right - web pages can be a lot of fun. Learning how to create web pages is easy and entertaining. This is my second paragraph. I hope you like it.
